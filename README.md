This project aims to analyse a coffee shop's sales data and answer questions about the sales of the shop that might help to increase revenue in the future. By finding out insights like peak sale hours, most selling product, most ordered sizes... the coffee shop can improve its target areas and devise a sound customer strategy going forward in the next fiscal year. The dashboard is dynamic in nature and the user can view day-wise as well as month-wise sales data of over 50 thousand transactions in an easy on the eye, easy to process format of pie charts and bar graphs. The visualised dataset comes handy to explain sales to employees who might not be vastly tech savy. The excel file and the questions the project aims to answers can be downloaded from the repository.
